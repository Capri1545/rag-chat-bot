The Solar System consists of the Sun and the astronomical objects gravitationally bound in orbit around it, all of which formed from the collapse of a giant molecular cloud approximately 4.6 billion years ago. These objects include eight planets, five dwarf planets, numerous moons, and billions of small Solar System bodies. The four inner planets are terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars), and the four outer planets are gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune).
