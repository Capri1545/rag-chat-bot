Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war. Mars is often referred to as the "Red Planet" because of the reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface, giving it a distinctive rusty hue. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.
