---


## üèÅ Phase 1: Project Kick-off & Requirements Definition

- **Defined Core Concept:** Intelligent Knowledge Base Assistant with RAG.
- **Established High-Level Features:** KB Ingestion, Semantic Search, LLM Integration, UI, Accuracy/Grounding.
- **Initial Tech Stack Proposed:** Python, Hugging Face Embeddings, FAISS, LangChain/LlamaIndex, Streamlit/Gradio, Ollama.
- **Created Initial Project Structure:** Root directory, .gitignore, README.md, PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md.
- **Sketched Architecture (Mermaid Diagram):** High-level data flow and component breakdown.

---


## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 2: Environment Setup & Data Ingestion

- **Environment Setup:** Created Python virtual environment, added core dependencies to `requirements.txt` (`langchain`, `sentence-transformers`, `faiss-cpu`, `pypdf`, `tiktoken`) and installed them.
- **Knowledge Base Preparation:** Created `data/knowledge_base/` directory and populated it with sample Solar System `.txt` files.
- **Implemented `ingest_data.py`:**
    - Functions for loading documents from `data/knowledge_base/` (supporting `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.md`).
    - Text chunking logic using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` (`CHUNK_SIZE`, `CHUNK_OVERLAP`).
    - Embedding generation using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
    - FAISS index creation from chunks and embeddings.
    - Saving/loading FAISS index and associated metadata to/from `data/faiss_index/`.
- **Executed `ingest_data.py`:** Successfully built and saved the FAISS vector store.

## üß© Phase 3: Retrieval & LLM Integration (Core RAG Pipeline)

- **Implemented Core RAG Logic** (in `query_assistant.py`, later refactored):
    - Loading the pre-built FAISS index and embedding model.
    - Initializing a local LLM (Ollama, e.g., mistral) or HuggingFacePipeline.
    - Constructing prompts for the LLM that include the user query and retrieved context.
    - Invoking the LLM to generate answers.
- **Developed Initial CLI:** A basic command-line interface in `query_assistant.py` for testing the RAG pipeline interactively.
- **Initial Hallucination Mitigation:** Applied an improved prompt template (`PROMPT_TEMPLATE`) to instruct the LLM to use only provided context and state "I don't have enough information" if applicable. (Initial limitations noted).

## üé® Phase 4: Enhancements, Refinements, and Evaluation (UI & Grounding)

### 4.1 Web User Interface (UI)
- **Refactored Codebase:** Split `query_assistant.py` into a modular `rag_pipeline.py` (containing the `RAGPipeline` class) and a new `app.py` for the UI.
- **Implemented Gradio UI (`app.py`):**
    - Used Gradio components (`gr.Textbox`, `gr.Button`, `gr.Markdown`, `gr.Blocks`) to create an interactive web application.
    - Integrated `RAGPipeline` into `app.py`, leveraging a global instance for efficient loading.
    - Added a "Clear" button for conversation reset.
    - **Source Display:** Shows `os.path.basename` of source files and a preview of the relevant text chunks.

### 4.2 Robust Hallucination Mitigation (Retrieval Thresholding)
- **Implemented in `rag_pipeline.py`:** Added `_get_relevant_documents_with_threshold` method.
- **Applied `RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD_L2`:** Filters retrieved documents based on L2 distance score; if no sufficiently relevant documents are found, the system pre-emptively returns the "no info" message without calling the LLM.
- **Tuning:** Acknowledged the need for tuning `RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD_L2` based on testing.

### 4.3 Error Handling & User Feedback
- **Implemented try-except blocks** around pipeline initialization and query execution in `app.py`.
- **Provided informative messages** (e.g., `st.spinner`, `st.error`, `st.warning`, `st.info`) for users.

### 4.4 Code Refactoring & Modularity (Intermediate)
- **Prepared for `config.py`** (though creation happens later in 5.3).


### 4.5 Evaluation Preparation
- **Created `data/evaluation_data.csv`:** A structured dataset of in-KB and out-of-KB questions for testing. (Initially had column mismatch, which was corrected).

---

## üöß Phase 5 (in progress): Advanced Refinements, Comprehensive Evaluation, and Documentation for Portfolio

### 5.1 Formalized Evaluation
- **Generated `evaluation_results.csv`:** Executed `evaluate.py` to run the RAG pipeline against `evaluation_data.csv` and capture raw responses.
- **CURRENTLY WORKING ON:** Manual assessment of `evaluation_results.csv` (filling in manual_... columns).
- **CURRENTLY WORKING ON:** Drafting `EVALUATION.md` report based on manual assessment.

### 5.2 Enhanced User Experience (UI Polish)
- **To be finalized after 5.1 is done.**
- Refining Gradio UI aesthetics, source display, etc.

### 5.3 Code Review & Final Polish
- **Created `config.py`:** Centralized all configuration constants from other files.
- **Updated other scripts:** Imported constants from `config.py`.
- **Added Docstrings:** For all classes and functions.
- **Added Inline Comments:** For complex logic.
- **Performed general code quality review.**

### 5.4 Comprehensive Documentation for Portfolio
- **To be finalized after 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 are done.**
- Revamping `README.md` with detailed sections, architecture, features, setup, evaluation summary, challenges, future work, etc.
- Capturing and embedding screenshots/GIFs of the Gradio app.
- Added a LICENSE file (MIT License) to the project root.

A production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that answers questions strictly from a local knowledge base using state-of-the-art open-source LLMs and embeddings. Built with Python, LangChain, HuggingFace, FAISS, and Gradio.
